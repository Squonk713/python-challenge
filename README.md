PyPoll and PyBank scripts

PyPoll analyses electoral data from "election_data.csv" and returns analysis as .txt file

PyBank analyses financial data from "budget_data.csv" and returns analysis as .txt file

#NOTE - the election_data.csv file is too large for me to upload to the GitHub repository - I'm not sure whether that is required?
